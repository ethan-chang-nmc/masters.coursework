# 1. Using the function rbinom in R, generate 1000 random deviates from a B(20,.4) distribution, 
#compute the sample mean and compare with the theoretical expectation.


# 2. Using the function rhyper in R, generate 1000 random deviates from a hypergeometric distribution 
# with 4 white balls, 8 black balls, and 3 balls drawn without replacement. Compute the sample mean 
# and compare with the theoretical expectation.


# 3. Using the function rexp in R, generate 1000 random deviates from an exponential with lambda=3. 
# Compute the sample mean and compare with the theoretical expectation, which is 1/lambda.
