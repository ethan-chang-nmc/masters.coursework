# Review example 5.4.5 on page 314 in the text. Simulate the estimators mu_hat_1 and mu_hat_2, 
# 1000 times using a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 5. Each of your 
# three random sample values will come from this distribution. Form the estimates and compare 
# to the theoretical expectation (discussed in Example 5.4.3) and theoretical variance given in 
# Example 5.4.5. You will be using the function rnorm in R.
